## This is my first post!

So I've been trying out [prose](http://prose.io) for editing the website and it's looking pretty good for now.! I have to say I'm quite impressed with the features so far, a little bit hard to figgure out some of the params (I'm looking at you `site` config).

Anyways. So far so good, looking forward to playing around with this (possibly even adopting it for the [company I work for](http://wetry.fun).
