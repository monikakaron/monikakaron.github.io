What I do recall from last excursions in programming is:
**COUNT the BLANKS, be sure of the AMOUNT if PARAGRAPHS!!!**
If you don´t, you will not end up with a viable solution and you will try to figure out why!!!
It will cost you hours of frustration until...you eventually...maybe (if you´re lucky) find that little something...missing piece or wrongly added item...
So, count it from the beggining!!! 
  _**THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS!!!**_
