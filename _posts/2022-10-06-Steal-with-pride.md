Now, I am a very, _**very stubborn**_ person (my children will go in as guarantees for that) and that is something that probably will help me a _looong way_ through this journey.
I do have an idea of what I want to learn and why, but I am really (really) **_a newbie_**!

First, I need to give a lot of cred to my baby brother that believes in me and just says ...**_"of course you will make it, no probs sis!_** And then he starts to describe, explain, come up with suggestions...and so forth...

I love my brother, but... I am such a new beginner that I need basic tutorials to go forward. Now we are talking **_basic tutorials_**! I look at the text, the words, the commands and feel so...STUPID! Wondering how I ever could go through medical school, work as a senior project manager on "high profile" projects...and just donÂ´t understand all the "curly braces", dots and links, and "soft breaks". But....now the **HUGE ADVANTAGE** of **STUBBORNNESS**!
