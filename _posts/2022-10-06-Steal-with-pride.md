# _**...one of the best pieces of advice ever received: STEAL WITH PRIDE!**_

# You don’t always need to re-invent the wheel, a simple re-design will do.

There is no use to invent things that already exist. **Use what you can find**, but don´t forget to **give credit to "the inventor"**. 

This way of thinking works splendidly even for learning how to write blog-posts. Copy the programming from a post from someone you know, try to figure out how it is written, re-design it so it works for you, and...publish. 

This is what I did when writing my first post; nicked a written one from my brother and then..._**stared at the text**_ !!! Wuuuha! I stared at it for quite a while, not figuring out the "syntax" or the "meanings". Realised in _**one dazzling moment**_ _I need to read/go through the **basic tutorials**_ ! Some basic coding to **understand** "commands" somewhere hidden in all this _magic coding text_ 

Now, this is where I´m struggling along now, the basic tutorials. Moving extremely slowly one baby step at a time...but _**having fun**_ and going in the right direction; **forward!**

Another insight today was...this web-template I´m using is a template for blog posts. So to follow my crumbling experiences creating a web-page with several pages, index, thumb nails, and so forth will be in a separate repository. _**More info to come, soon, don´t want to loose the fans (optimist as I am) I have.**_

### TAKE CARE :-)!
