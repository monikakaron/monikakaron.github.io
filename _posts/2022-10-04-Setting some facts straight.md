I do realise my limitations, at least some of them...
Starting from scratch still means that I needed some good person having mercy to help me to get out from my "starting blocks". That person for me was (and still is) my baby brother. So, I have **_not_** installed:

* www.github.com
* www.jekyllrb.com
* www.prose.io  
* [So Simple Themes- a Jekyll template](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/)

... on my computer, but after that itÂ´s me being **"the great hero" _wingling about and trying my best_ :-)**
