# **Now just to get some facts straight...**

I do realise my limitations, at least some of them...
Starting from scratch still means that I needed some good person having mercy to help me to get out from my "starting blocks". That person for me was (and still is) my baby brother. So, I have **_not_** installed:

* www.github.com
* www.jekyllrb.com
* www.prose.io  
* [So Simple Themes- a Jekyll template](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/)

... on my computer, but after that it´s me being **"the great hero"** _wingling about and trying my best_ :-)

So going through tutorials and trying out different approaches... I´m moving forward. Doing that, one of the more interesting advices a "dinsoaurie" like me get is: _"if you have a question, just google it"_ 

Now, when the earth was young and we dinosaures where babies... the internet where just in its cradle. _"world wide web"_ , no one had ever heard of it! 

_Mobile phones_...would take years for them to come. What we had was this: [teenagers figuring out a stationary phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHNEzndgiFI)

So...it is a bit of a new journey to just _"google it"_ and...amazingly loads of people write suggestions, thoughts, possibilites and _**eventually...there is a chance to get somewhere near the answer**_.
