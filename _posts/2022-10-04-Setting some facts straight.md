I do realise my limitations, at least some of them...
Starting from scratch still means that I need some good people to help me in the "starting blocks". That person from me is my baby brother. So, I have not installed:
* www.GitHub.com
* www.Jekyll.com
* www.Prose.com
* a Jekyll template 

... on my computer, but after that itÂ´s me being **"the great hero"** _wingling about and trying my best_ **:-)**
