I do realise my limitations, at least some of them...
Starting from scratch still means that I need some good people to help me to get out from my "starting blocks". That person for me is my baby brother. So, I have not installed:
* www.github.com
* www.jekyllrb.com
* www.prose.io
* [So Simple Themes, a Jekyll template] (www.mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/)

... on my computer, but after that itÂ´s me being **"the great hero" _wingling about and trying my best_ :-)**
