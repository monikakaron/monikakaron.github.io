# Testing a whole different world of new "fun" things with a lot of swearing and much help from my baby brother :-)

Now, I a am very _very stubborn_ person (my children will go in as guarantees for that) and that is something that probably will help me a looong way through this journey.

I do have an idea what I want to learn and why, but I am really really a newbeginner!

First, I need to give a lot of cred to my baby brother that believes in me and just say..**_"of course you will make it, no probs sis!_** And then he starts to describe, explain, come with suggestions...and so forth...

I love my brother, but... I am so a new beginner that I need basic tutorials to go forward. Now we are talking of really basic tutorials! I look at the text, the words, the commands and feel so...STUPID!
