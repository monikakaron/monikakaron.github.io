# _**...of new "fun" things with a lot of swearing and much help from my baby brother :-)**_

Now, I am a very, _**very stubborn**_ person (my children will go in as guarantees for that) and that is something that probably will help me a _looong way_ through this journey.
I do have an idea of what I want to learn and why, but I am really (really) **_a newbee_**!

First, I need to give a lot of cred to my baby brother that believes in me and just says ...**_"of course you will make it, no probs sis!_** And then he starts to describe, explain, come up with suggestions...and so forth...

I love my brother, but... I am such a new beginner that I need basic tutorials to go forward. Now we are talking **_really basic tutorials_**! I look at the text, the words, the commands and feel so...STUPID! Wondering how I ever could go through medical school, work as a senior project manager on "high profile" projects...and just donÂ´t understand all the "curly braces", dots and links, and "soft breaks". But....now the **HUGE ADVANTAGE** of **STUBBORNNESS**!

**AND**, with hours, invested I can conclude that:
* [Markdown tutorial](https://markdowntutorial.com/), this is the place to start! Easy beginning and " _the base_ " to have to understand _basic_ commands when using Jekyll on GitHub.
* [Jekyll Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), in my case, just going through the tutorial step by step. Reading and re-reading to understand the words and figuring out what "Liquid" is...
It is important not to get too _stuck_ with all the " _magic_ " things Liquid can do. Just " _take the basic_ " and move on...the rest will (hopefully) come later **:-)**
* [HTML tutorial](https://w3schools.com/html/), a good tutorial to have on the side as a " _cheating document_ ", when you need just to wrap your head around some programming words or references (if you are not an HTML programmer from scratch).
* [Questions on template so-simple-themes-Jekyll](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/markup/markup-image-alignment/), interesting to find the possibilities where one can search for a lot of _answers_ to the _heap_ amount of questions that (at least I) a person can have...
