# _**...of new "fun" things with a lot of swearing and much help from my baby brother :-)**_

Now, I a am very _**very stubborn**_ person (my children will go in as guarantees for that) and that is something that probably will help me a _looong way_ through this journey.
I do have an idea what I want to learn and why, but I am really really **_a newbee_**!

First, I need to give a lot of cred to my baby brother that believes in me and just say..**_"of course you will make it, no probs sis!_** And then he starts to describe, explain, come with suggestions...and so forth...

I love my brother, but... I am such a new beginner that I need basic tutorials to go forward. Now we are talking of **_really basic tutorials_**! I look at the text, the words, the commands and feel so...STUPID! Wondering how I ever could go through medical school, work as a senior project manager on "high valued" projects...and just donÂ´t understand all the "curly braces", dots and links and "soft breaks". But....now the **HUGE ADVANTAGE** of **STUBBORNESS**!

**AND**, with hours invested I can conclude that:
* [markdown tutorial] (https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), this is the place to start! Easy beginning and "_the base_"to have to understand basic commands when using Jekyll on GitHub.
* [Jekyll Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), in my case, just going through the tutorial step by step. Reading and re-reading to understand the words and figuiring out what "Liquid" is...
* [HTML tutorial] (https://www.w3schools.com/html/), a good tutorial to have on a side as a "_cheating document_", when you need just to understand some programming (if your not a HTML-programmer from scratch).
