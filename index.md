## Welcome to my personal site

I am what people would call an ancient **dinosaurie** who am now taking my first crumbling steps to learn to create my own web page on GitHub with Jekyll.
Trust me, this will be a loong journey with loads of detours and fun misstakes, but if you would like to _"hop on"_ on my journey I sure will enjoy the company. 

Going through different tutorials I realise that there is a lot of **words, mindsets and "logics"** I need to get "**_my hands around_**" just to understand the basic. But, not giving up...**_trying to keep going strong_**!

As the web page will be built up, you will see more features come along, with no **_logical_** start. Info just comes along the more I (hopefully) learn...
The best ways to learn things are trying, testing, doing misstakes and trying again...**_so here we go :-)!_**
